Find which pages on the XY (language) wikipedia have no links to corresponding pages on the English Wikipedia.
These articles either need an interwiki link to English (and one from English back to this page) or they need
to be translated to English first.


Ideas for improvement:
	Show the date of the dumping


	Separate fetching dump
	Loading dump to database
	Generating HTML


	Separate database for each language (probably only needed if we would like to have live queries in a dynamic application)
	Instead of static pages of the top 100 articles, create a dynamic page. (Why would this be good?)

	Maybe we would like to have some cross-language statistics? (e.g. the largest pages without English links among all the wikipedias?)
